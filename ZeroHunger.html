            <p> Zero Hunger, the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) of the United Nations, sets an ambitious target: to eradicate hunger and all forms of malnutrition across the globe by the year 2030. This goal recognizes that food is a fundamental human right and that a world where people suffer from hunger is neither just nor sustainable. Achieving Zero Hunger requires a multifaceted approach that addresses not only the availability of food but also its accessibility, affordability, and nutritional quality for all individuals, particularly the most vulnerable populations</p>
            <p> The scope of Zero Hunger extends beyond simply providing enough calories. It encompasses ending undernourishment, achieving food security, and improving nutrition. This includes tackling issues such as stunting and wasting in children, addressing micronutrient deficiencies, and promoting sustainable agriculture. The goal also emphasizes the need for resilient food production systems that can adapt to climate change and other shocks, as well as reducing food loss and waste throughout the supply chain, from production to consumption.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, achieving Zero Hunger is intrinsically linked to other SDGs. Hunger and malnutrition can hinder progress in education, health, economic growth, and gender equality. Conversely, advancements in these areas can contribute to improved food security and nutrition. Therefore, a collaborative and integrated approach is essential, involving governments, international organizations, the private sector, civil society, and individuals working together to build a food-secure and nourished world for all.</p>
